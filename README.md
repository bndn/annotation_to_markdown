# Annotation to Markdown

A Ruby script to extract eBooks annotations from your eReader device to Markdown files, ready to be published with Jekyll.

Built for [cdrc](https://github.com/cdrc) who uses it with his Cybook Odyssey eReader.

## Usage

Download the script:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sphax3d/annotation_to_markdown.git
    $ cd annotation_to_markdown

Define some parameters in the script:

- `XML_DIRECTORY` is the source directory of your eBooks annotations on the eReader device.
- `MD_DRECTORY` is the destination directory of the extracted annotations in Markdown.
- `MD_TEMPLATE` is the template of the annotation files in Markdown. The default template is used to publish a quote with Jekyll.

Create the destination directory of the annotations if necessary:

    $ mkdir markdown-annotations

Plug your device and launch the script:

    $ ruby annotation_to_markdown.rb

Check out your destination directory !
